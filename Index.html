          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            Abstract Art is a non-objective art, which does not have an accurate representation of a visual reality.
            The purpose of this painting type is to add a meaningful message to
            a completely disfigured painting.

          <p>
            A portrait painting or drawing depicts the image of a particular person or animal, or group thereof. The subject of a portrait is usually called a "sitter", because traditionally people would sit in front of the artist to have their portrait painted.
